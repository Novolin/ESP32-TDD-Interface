# ESP32-TDD-Interface
A TDD -> USB (and others) interface for TDD devices, capable of audio decoding and encoding


## Goals:

- Create a system capable of engaging with a TDD over audio, in both directions.
- Decode as serial text output to use as a TTY on a host system
- Allow direct decoded baudot modem signals to a baudot-capable device (targeted at my own homebrew computer)

## Hardware List:
- ESP32 clone from AliExpress
- more tbd
